CodeChuckle is introducing a new diff tool: SnickerSyncâ€”why merge in silence when you can sync 
with a snicker? The PMs have a solid understanding of what it means to "sync with a snicker" and 
now they want to run some user studies. Your team has already created a vanilla interface capable 
of syncing with the base GiggleGit packages.
